2023-05-03 | vscode-neovim | Add 'expand and shrink selection' functionality
             Partially implemented. See ~/.vimrc `v` shortcut. Blocked on https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim/issues/1212.

TODO:
2023-04-28 | all vim | Update to prompt before loading settings.
                Not the `~/.vimrc.local` ones, only the `./.vim/*` ones.
                See: `call SourceFileIfExists(".vim/vimrc.local.loadbefore")` in `~/.vimrc`.
                Prompt once, save "marked safe" status somewhere for file hash, don't prompt again.
