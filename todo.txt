2023-04-28 | all vim | Update to prompt before loading settings.
                Not the `~/.vimrc.local` ones, only the `./.vim/*` ones.
                See: `call SourceFileIfExists(".vim/vimrc.local.loadbefore")` in `~/.vimrc`.
                Prompt once, save "marked safe" status somewhere for file hash, don't prompt again.
